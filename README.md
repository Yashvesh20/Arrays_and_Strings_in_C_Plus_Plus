Arrarys:

An array in C or C++ is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations and elements can be accessed randomly using indices of an array. They can be used to store the collection of primitive data types such as int, float, double, char, etc of any particular type.

+ One Dimensional Array
  
+ Multi Dimensional Array

1. One Dimensional Array: A one dimensional array is a collection of same data.

2. Multi-Dimensional Array: A multi-dimensional array is also known as array of arrays. It is also known as the matrix. 

Strings:

C++ string class internally uses character array to store character but all memory management, allocation, and null termination are handled by string class itself that is why it is easy to use.

# Implementation:
The following cases demonstrate the usage of arrays and strings in C++
+ Basic array decleration and printing
+ Array element Search
+ Min and Max Values in Arrays
+ Reverse Array

# Algorithms:

For Arrays :

Algorithm: Linear Search in an Array

1. Start

2. Declare an integer array num of size 10 and initialize with {20,22,56,220}

3. Declare an integer variable key.

4. Display a message: "Enter the value to search in the array:".

5. Read the value of key from the user.

6. Loop variable j from 0 to 4:

If key == num[j]:

7. Display "Key found at Location:" followed by j.

8. Exit the loop.

9. End


Algorithm: Reverse a String

1. Start

2. Declare a string variable str.

3. Declare an integer variable n.

4. Display the message: "Enter a String:".

5. Read the string str from the user.

6. Set n = length of str.

7. For i from n-1 down to 0:

8. Display str[i].

9. End


# Conclusion:
We have implemented programs of Strings and Array in C++
